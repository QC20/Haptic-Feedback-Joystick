# Joystick Interface for Arduino

**Author:** Jonas K. Jensen  
**Date:** July 10th, 2023

## Description
This repository contains an Arduino sketch that interfaces with a joystick to read analog values from its X and Y axes. The sketch prints the X and Y axis values to the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE.

## Getting Started
To use this code, you will need an Arduino board and a joystick with X and Y analog outputs. Connect the VRX and VRY pins from the joystick to the corresponding analog pins on the Arduino board.

## Hardware Setup

1. Connect the X-axis output of the joystick to the VRX_PIN (Analog pin 0) on the Arduino.
2. Connect the Y-axis output of the joystick to the VRY_PIN (Analog pin 1) on the Arduino.

## Software Setup
1. Install the Arduino IDE on your computer if you haven't already.
2. Open the `joystick_interface.ino` sketch file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

## Usage

1. Connect the Arduino to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (`Tools > Serial Monitor`).
3. Make sure the baud rate is set to 9600.
4. You should see the X and Y axis values printed to the Serial Monitor.
5. Move the joystick in different directions to observe changes in the values.

## Notes

- The `delay(200)` in the `loop()` function introduces a small delay (200 milliseconds) between readings to prevent excessive data output. You can adjust this value according to your needs.
- Ensure that the joystick is properly calibrated and functioning to obtain accurate readings.
